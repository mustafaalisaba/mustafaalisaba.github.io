<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Mustafa Ali Saba, I am 1st year phD student at Autonomous University of Puebla (LKE program) in Mexico.
    My research interest focuses on language understanding by machines for the social good. In broad, I am interested in providing 
    commonsense reasoning to computers to improve life. In particular, my goals are the searching of mathematical models for commonsense
    reasoning and representation in anaphoric text passages natural or artificially created.
